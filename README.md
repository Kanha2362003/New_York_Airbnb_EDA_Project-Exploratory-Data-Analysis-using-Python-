# New_York_Airbnb_EDA_Project-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-using-Python-
A data analytics project exploring the Airbnb listings dataset for New York City. This project demonstrates practical data analysis skills using Python and showcases insights about pricing, availability, neighborhoods, and host behavior across the five boroughs of NYC.
📌 Objective
The main goal of this project is to analyze the Airbnb dataset of New York City to:

Identify pricing trends by neighborhood and room types

Detect outliers and anomalies in listings

Explore availability and seasonal behavior of hosts

Analyze relationships between variables such as reviews, prices, and locations

Visualize data using interactive and static charts for storytelling

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python 3.x

Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn – Visualization

Plotly – Interactive plots

Jupyter Notebook – Code development and analysis

(Optional): Folium – For geographical data visualization

📊 Key Analysis Steps
1. 🔍 Data Understanding
Load dataset

Check missing values

Understand datatypes and basic statistics

2. 🧹 Data Cleaning
Handle nulls (e.g., reviews_per_month, last_review)

Remove duplicates

Convert data types (e.g., date parsing)

Remove unrealistic values (e.g., price = 0, minimum_nights > 365)

3. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution of room types and neighborhood groups

Top hosts by number of listings

Pricing analysis by neighborhood and room type

Availability trends over the year

Relationship between reviews and price/availability

Heatmaps and correlation analysis

Outlier detection using IQR method

4. 📍 Geographic Analysis (Optional)
Use Folium or Plotly for mapping

Analyze listings spatially by price, reviews, etc.
